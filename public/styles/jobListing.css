Based on the plan of action, the code modification will involve creating a new CSS file named jobListing.css within the public/styles directory. This file will contain specific styles for job listings, including layout adjustments, font styles, color schemes, margins, paddings, borders, shadows, and responsiveness. The separation into a new file ensures modularity and prevents interference with global styles defined in main.css.

Additionally, the code will reference views/jobListing.ejs to ensure consistency in class and ID names used for styling, maintaining a coherent design language across the application. Media queries will also be included in jobListing.css to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes, enhancing the user experience on mobile devices.

The code modification will be implemented with the utmost care, ensuring that the code works on the first try and is syntactically perfect and complete. All functions and classes will be fully implemented, taking into account the current repository's language, frameworks, and dependencies. The code will strictly follow the steps outlined in the code planning for file creation and implementation.
