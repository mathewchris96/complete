As a meticulous engineer, I will carefully follow the plan of action to create the file and implement the necessary steps. I will use the current repository's language, frameworks, and dependencies to ensure seamless integration with the existing codebase.

First, I will create a new file for the frontend logic and name it appropriately based on the project's naming conventions. Within this file, I will implement functions to validate email format before sending OTP and to handle OTP submission for verification. These functions will be thoroughly tested to ensure they work as intended.

Next, I will ensure that the file interacts with the backend through AJAX calls to send and verify OTP. I will carefully integrate these AJAX calls with the existing backend code to maintain consistency and efficiency.

Throughout the process, I will pay close attention to detail and ensure that the code is syntactically perfect and complete. I will also thoroughly test the code to verify its functionality and address any potential issues.

By following the plan of action and maintaining the utmost care for the code, I will ensure that the file is successfully implemented and seamlessly integrates with the existing project.
