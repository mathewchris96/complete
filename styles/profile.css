Based on the plan of action, I will write code in the current repository's language, using the existing frameworks and dependencies. I will define CSS styles for the new HTML elements added to profile.ejs, ensuring that the styles are consistent with the existing design language of the site. I will focus on readability and layout of the new information, and include classes for form elements that may be used for updating user information, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly interface. I will carefully implement each function and class, ensuring that the code works on the first try and is syntactically perfect and complete. I will follow only what is present in the code planning steps for code modification, and ensure that the utmost care is taken in writing the code.
