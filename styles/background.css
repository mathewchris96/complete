Based on the plan of action, I will create a new file called "background.css" in the "styles" directory. I will then implement the necessary CSS properties to handle the styling of the background image as specified in the plan. This includes setting the image as a background, positioning it 100 pixels below the top, ensuring it does not overlap with the navbar or footer, and applying a faint effect for readability using properties such as background-image, background-position, and opacity.

I will ensure that the code is syntactically perfect and complete, following the current repository's language, frameworks, and dependencies. I will also make sure to only follow the steps provided in the code planning for code modification, without making any unnecessary changes.

By following these steps with utmost care and attention to detail, I will ensure that the code works on the first try and is fully implemented according to the plan. This will result in a well-maintained and organized codebase, with a clear separation of concerns for better maintainability.
