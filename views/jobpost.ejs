As a meticulous engineer, I will follow the plan of action to create the file and implement the necessary steps. Since the plan specifies using ejs for the file, I will ensure that the file is created in the views directory with the name jobpost.ejs. I will then proceed to add the necessary HTML structure and form elements for the job application form within the file.

Next, I will import the submitJobPosting function from the interactivity.js file using a script tag to ensure form functionality. I will also reference any necessary CSS files for styling to maintain consistency with the site's design.

I will ensure that the code is syntactically perfect and complete, and I will not make any mistakes in the implementation of the functions and classes. I will also take into account the current repository's language, frameworks, and dependencies to ensure that the code integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.

Overall, I will approach the task with the utmost care and attention to detail, ensuring that the code works on the first try and meets all the requirements specified in the plan of action.
