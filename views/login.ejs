Based on the plan of action, I will write code to create the login.ejs file in the views directory. I will include the HTML structure for the login form, including input fields for username and password, and a submission button. I will also include links to any necessary CSS or JavaScript files for styling and functionality. I will ensure that the form action is set to the appropriate route for handling login submissions, typically '/login'. Additionally, I will reference authRoutes.js to ensure that the login route is correctly set up to render this page upon redirection and after direct navigation by users.

I will ensure that the code is written in the language and framework specified in the current repository, and I will follow the existing dependencies and guidelines for code modification. I will implement the functions and classes as per the plan, ensuring that the code is syntactically perfect and complete. I will also thoroughly test the code to ensure it works on the first try and does not contain any mistakes.
