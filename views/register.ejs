As a meticulous engineer, I will carefully follow the plan of action to create the "register.ejs" file in the "complete/views" directory. I will ensure that the file contains the HTML structure for the registration form, including form fields for user registration such as username, email, and password. Additionally, I will make sure that the "register.ejs" file is rendered when the "/register" route is accessed.

I will use the current repository's language, frameworks, and dependencies to write the code for the file. I will pay close attention to detail and ensure that the code is syntactically perfect and complete. I will implement every function and class as required in the code planning steps for code modification.

By following the plan of action and applying my meticulous approach to coding, I will create a flawless "register.ejs" file that meets all the specified requirements.
